Machine Learning internship
----------------------------------
1. The file skills_copy.py is the python file with the ML development and result prediction algorithm.

2. Libraries used : Pandas, csv, Sci-Kit Learn

3. The file 'Example_Technical_skills' was used as a reference to create a training sample. The copy of the file was created to which more soft skills, technical skills and random phrases were added to create a training dataset of 3000+ data samples.

4. The file was imported into the program using Pandas Library.

5. After selecting the column required to assess the data, a pipeline was created consisting of CountVectorizer to vectorize the words and RandomForestClassifier to create text classification model. 

6. The Dataset was passed into it and the ML model was created which has 85 (+-2)% Accuracy was created.

7. The Prediction file was imported along with the creation of the files to write down the classified Technical skills and Non technical skills.

8. The prediction file was iterated over through the prediction of the pipeline and the ones identified as technical skills were written to the Technical-skills file and the non technical ones into the Soft-skills file.
